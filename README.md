# buldozer_price_project
 
How well can we predict the future sale price of a bulldozer, given it's characteristics and previous examples of how much similar bulldozers have been sold for ?

Still have not exported the Machine Learning model, I will after improving it more.

Exported a environment I used for you to freely import it if you want to see what I did.

In this project I used:

pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn

Model used is:

RandomForestRegressor

After improving it a lot (tuning hyperparameters) RMSLE (root mean squared log error) was 0.245, which is enough to be in top 20 for competition this project was based on.
